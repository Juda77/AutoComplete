# Auto Complete
Programmed an autocomplete feature for search bars. This autocomplete implementation is optimized using the Trie data structure,
as well as a recursive algorithm. 
This version is a refined version of my original auto complete program from my introductory java homework, and it is refined to handle multiple words
instead of just one.
